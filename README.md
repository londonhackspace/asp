# ASP

A Java-based ActiveServer Pages implementation compatible with CloudFoundry.

## Build instructions

This repository should be self-contained. The WAR file can be built using `ant`, with the resulting WAR file being deposited in `dist_war/`. 


## Usage

See build instructions. Update the contents in web/ with your ASP VBScript application.


## Disclaimer

This repository is a joke. Well, a practical one. The resulting code runs. You can actually run ASP VBScript with this on CloudFoundry or standard Java servlet containers. But please, don't run any production payloads (i.e. the LHS website) on them.
